Welcome to my project portfolio. This repository features a selection of example projects highlighting my work in statistical analysis, machine learning with Python, and Power BI reporting.

The content here reflects my ongoing development as a data analyst, with a focus on applying data-driven solutions in real-world contexts particularly within the healthcare sector. Iâ€™ll be updating this space regularly as I complete new projects, with the goal of building a well-rounded showcase of my technical skills and analytical approach.
